# Json to Sql converter

A simple json parser that converts json to sql queries. All the parsed queries are exported to a `.sql` file. This project is written in Haskell Programming language. All the parsers have been written from scratch and no external library has been used.

## Features

- Supports Table Creation
- Supports Insertion of data
- Handles arrays and nested objects
- Supports multiple data types

## Installing

> WIP

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to learn functional programming language and this was the best way for me. I chose to implement this project idea as I needed to get some base knowledge around parsers and improve the current online json2sql parsers we have on the web. I won't recommend this to use for complex jsons but for simple jsons, this should work fine.
